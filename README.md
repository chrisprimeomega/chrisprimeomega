## TIPS WITH BENEFITS
Your tip can help me develop, just send any crypto to one of the following addresses on the networks:<br>
|Solana|ETH/Polygon/BSC...|BTC|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|

**If you want to send a tip using a different chain, let me know and I will add it.**<br><br>
**What is the benefit for you?** <br>
First of all, you support me in my development, for which I am eternally grateful.<br>
Yes, I know, this benefit is weak, so there will be a second one.<br>
Secondly, in the near future I plan to start the Œ©Fund project.<br>
Looking at the name of the project, it is easy to guess that it will be some kind of experimental investment fund (I know it's a serious name, but it's probably the closest term) focused on cryptocurrencies and run by Me. To participate in it, you will need to purchase a token or NFT (I haven't decided yet). More details coming soon, but you can treat each of your tips as an additional investment.<br>
The token/nft will be minted on the Solana network because the cost-performance ratio is the best on this network imho. Therefore, if you send me a tip via the Solana network, you do not have to do anything, you will simply receive tokens/nft to the same address, after token/nft launch. However, if you want to send the tip via a different network, please write to me your Solana address at X before sending it. Why before sending? because after sending, someone else may see the transaction and try to impersonate you.
